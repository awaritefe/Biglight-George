## Optimisations

Lazy Loading JavaScript on images

## ðŸš€ What would i do with more time...

- Would like to refactor code in Index.js to remove duplicate code and use function to clean up the routes.
- Change the mobile header styling with JS into a Vue.js version.
- Create a base ejs file to extend other view pages in, to minimise head code duplication.
- Look into a way to loop through components rather than hard coding all of them out.

## ðŸ›  Technology i would liked to use in this project with more time...

Vue, TailwindCSS, Vite
